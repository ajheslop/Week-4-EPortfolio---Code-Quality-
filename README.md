# Week-4-EPortfolio---Code-Quality-

## 1.Analyse and improve the code quality of an existing code base:
	- Identify and resolve stylistic issues (including naming conventions) 
	- Identify and resolve instances of code that violates Single Responsibility Principle 
	- Identify and resolve instances of WET code
	- Provide at least 1 example of Extract Function
	- Provide at least 1 example of Extract Variable 

## 2. Write your own one-page style guide:
	- Create a one-page document that gives code examples of good and bad style 
	- E.g. How to deal with line continuations
	- Read this for guidance: https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/style/
